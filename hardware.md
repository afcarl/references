Fast algorithms for convolutional neural networks
Basic computation of the optimized Winograd algorithm.
Keywords: Winograd, CNN.

Minimizing computation in convolutional neural networks
Strassen MM algorithm applied to CNNs. Good first step to understanding the idea behind using Winograd-Coppersmith.
Table 1 results seem suspect. Layer 1 convolution takes half as much as layer 1 maxpooling. This is unlikely.
Keywords: Winograd, CNN.

Deep Compression: Compressing Deep Neural Networks with Pruning, Trained Quantization and Huffman Coding
Deep compression.
Keywords: Weight Compression.

Eyeriss: An Energy-Efficient Reconfigurable Accelerator for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
MIT's CNN chip..
Keywords: Eyeriss, CNN, ASIC.
